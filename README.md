### Hi there 👋

I'm primarily a **JavaScript Front-End developer** and a musician. I'm currently dabbing in some other languages and tech that interest me.
I'm always trying to learn how stuff works and to use it in creative ways and I also love sharing the knowledge that I've acquired with others.
I'm also a co-organizer @freeCodeCampBA and I'm also in our front-end/UI-UX channel in Slack whenever I can to help people out.

My current Tech Stack is:
- React (CRA, NextJS or Gatsby) Based Front-End
- React Native
- NodeJS or Express based Back-End
- ES6+
- Styled Components

🎵️ I like to write and play music.

📚️ I'm currently Studying a career related to Arts and Technology.

🔭 I’m currently working on my personal portfolio and various personal projects.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's JS related, specially if it's related to React (the library that I most commonly use). Feel free to hit me up for anything that involves translations between English and Spanish :smile:.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and focusing much more on accessibility features and design.

📫 You can find me in front-end/UI-UX channel in freeCodeCampBA's Slack.
